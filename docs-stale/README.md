This folder contains a snapshot of the previously generated `docs/` site output.

It was moved to `docs-stale/` to avoid GitHub Pages serving the old static output while the repository now uses the GitHub Actions Pages artifact.

If you need the old files restored, you can rename this folder back to `docs/` or find the files in git history.

Do not delete this folder unless you are sure you don't need the old build artifacts.
