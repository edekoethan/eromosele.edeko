Carica papaya is a herbaceous plant used as food and in traditional medicine. This study evaluated the aqueous extract of C. papaya leaves for effects on catalepsy, depressive‑like behavior, and convulsions. Phytochemical screening detected carbohydrates, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, and tannins, and the LD50 was >5000 mg/kg. Tests included haloperidol‑induced catalepsy, the forced swim and tail suspension tests, and PTZ‑ and MES‑induced seizure models, with extract doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg. The extract significantly reduced mean cataleptic score at higher doses and decreased immobility time in both the forced swim and tail suspension tests at all doses (p < 0.05), but it did not protect against PTZ‑ or MES‑induced seizures. These findings indicate C. papaya possesses central nervous system–modifying activity.
